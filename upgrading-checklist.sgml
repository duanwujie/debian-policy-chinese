<chapt> About the checklist
<p>
The checklist below has been created to simplify the upgrading process
of old packages.  Note that this list is not "official"; it simply
gives an indication of what has changed and whether you are likely to
need to make changes to your package in light of this.  If you have
doubts about a certain topic, if you need more details, or if you
think some other package does not comply with policy, please refer to
the Policy Manual itself.  All of the changes from version 3.0.0
onwards indicate which section of the Policy Manual discusses the
issue: [3.4] means section 3.4.  The section numbering changed when
the packaging manual was incorporated into policy; the section numbers
used below refer to the current version.
<p>
Here is how the check list works: Check which policy version your
package was checked against last (indicated in the "Standards-Version"
field of the source package).  Then move upwards until the top and
check which of the items on the list might concern your package.  Note
which sections of policy discuss this, and then check out the Policy
Manual for details.  If you are upgrading from Policy version &lt; 2.5.0,
it may be easier to check through the whole of policy instead of
picking your way through this list.

<sect id="3.9.4.0"> Version 3.9.4.0
<p>

Unreleased.

</p><p><taglist>
<tag>2.4</tag>
  <item>New <em>tasks</em> archive section.
  </item>
<tag>5.6.26</tag>
  <item>New section documenting the <tt>Vcs-*</tt> fields, which are
  already in widespread use.  Note the mechanism for specifying the Git
  branch used for packaging in the Vcs-Git field.
  </item>
<tag>7.1</tag>
  <item>The deprecated relations &lt; and &gt; now must not be used.
  </item>
<tag>7.8</tag>
  <item>New <tt>Built-Using</tt> field, which must be used to document the
  source packages for any binaries that are incorporated into this package
  at build time.  This is used to ensure that the archive meets license
  requirements for providing source for all binaries.
  </item>
<tag>9.1.1</tag>
  <item>Packages must not assume the <file>/run</file> directory exists or
  is usable without a dependency on <tt>initscripts (>= 2.88dsf-13.3)</tt>
  until the stable release of Debian supports <file>/run</file>.
  </item>
<tag>12.5</tag>
  <item>All copyright files must be encoded in UTF-8.
  </item>
</taglist></p>

<sect id="3.9.3.0"> Version 3.9.3.0
<p>

Released February, 2012.

</p><p><taglist>
<tag>2.4</tag>
  <item>New archive sections <em>education</em>, <em>introspection</em>,
  and <em>metapackages</em> added.
  </item>
<tag>5.6.8</tag>
  <item>The <tt>Architecture</tt> field in <file>*.dsc</file> files may
  now contain the value <tt>any all</tt> for source packages building both
  architecture-independent and architecture-dependent packages.
  </item>
<tag>7.1</tag>
  <item>If a dependency is restricted to particular architectures, the
  list of architectures must be non-empty.
  </item>
<tag>9.1.1</tag>
  <item><file>/run</file> is allowed as an exception to the FHS and
  replaces <file>/var/run</file>.  <file>/run/lock</file>
  replaces <file>/var/lock</file>.  The FHS requirements for the older
  directories apply to these directories as well.  Backward compatibility
  links will be maintained and packages need not switch to
  referencing <file>/run</file> directly yet.  Files in <file>/run</file>
  should be stored in a temporary file system.
  </item>
<tag>9.1.4</tag>
  <item>New section spelling out the requirements for packages that use
  files in <file>/run</file>, <file>/var/run</file>,
  or <file>/var/lock</file>.  This generalizes information previously only
  in 9.3.2.
  </item>
<tag>9.5</tag>
  <item>Cron job file names must not contain <tt>.</tt> or <tt>+</tt> or
  they will be ignored by cron.  They should replace those characters
  with <tt>_</tt>.  If a package provides multiple cron job files in the
  same directory, they should each start with the package name (possibly
  modified as above), <tt>-</tt>, and then some suitable suffix.
  </item>
<tag>9.10</tag>
  <item>Packages using doc-base do not need to call install-docs anymore.
  </item>
<tag>10.7.4</tag>
  <item>Packages that declare the same <tt>conffile</tt> may see left-over
  configuration files from each other even if they conflict.
  </item>
<tag>11.8</tag>
  <item>The Policy rules around Motif libraries were just a special case
  of normal rules for non-free dependencies and were largely obsolete, so
  they have been removed.
  </item>
<tag>12.5</tag>
  <item><file>debian/copyright</file> is no longer required to list the
  Debian maintainers involved in the creation of the package (although
  note that the requirement to list copyright information is unchanged).
  </item>
<tag>copyright-format</tag>
  <item>Version 1.0 of the "Machine-readable <file>debian/copyright</file>
  file" specification is included.
  </item>
<tag>mime</tag>
  <item>This separate document has been retired and and its (short)
  contents merged into Policy section 9.7.  There are no changes to the
  requirements.
  </item>
<tag>perl</tag>
  <item>Packages may declare an interest in the <var>perl-major-upgrade</var> 
  trigger to be notified of major upgrades of perl.
  </item>
<tag>virtual</tag>
  <item><tt>ttf-japanese-{mincho, gothic}</tt> is renamed to 
        <tt>fonts-japanese-{mincho, gothic}</tt>.
  </item>
</taglist></p>

<sect id="3.9.2.0"> Version 3.9.2.0
<p>

Released April, 2011.

</p><p><taglist>
<tag>*</tag>
  <item>Multiple clarifications throughout Policy where "installed" was
  used and the more precise terms "unpacked" or "configured" were
  intended.
  </item>
<tag>3.3</tag>
  <item>The maintainer address must accept mail from Debian role accounts
  and the BTS.  At least one human must be listed with their personal
  email address in <tt>Uploaders</tt> if the maintainer is a shared email
  address.  The duties of a maintainer are also clearer.
  </item>
<tag>5</tag>
  <item>All control fields are now classified as simple, folded, or
  multiline, which governs whether their values must be a single line or
  may be continued across multiple lines and whether line breaks are
  significant.
  </item>
<tag>5.1</tag>
  <item>Parsers are allowed to accept paragraph separation lines
  containing whitespace, but control files should use completely empty
  lines.  Ordering of paragraphs is significant.  Field names must be
  composed of printable ASCII characters except colon and must not begin
  with #.
  </item>
<tag>5.6.25</tag>
  <item>The <tt>DM-Upload-Allowed</tt> field is now documented.
  </item>
<tag>6.5</tag>
  <item>The system state maintainer scripts can rely upon during each
  possible invocation is now documented.  In several less-common cases,
  this is stricter than Policy had previously documented.  Packages with
  complex maintainer scripts should be reviewed in light of this new
  documentation.
  </item>
<tag>7.2</tag>
  <item>The impact on system state when maintainer scripts that are part
  of a circular dependency are run is now documented.  Circular
  dependencies are now a should not.
  </item>
<tag>7.2</tag>
  <item>The system state when <prgn>postinst</prgn> and <prgn>prerm</prgn>
  scripts are run is now documented, and the documentation of the special
  case of dependency state for <prgn>postrm</prgn> scripts has been
  improved.  <prgn>postrm</prgn> scripts are required to gracefully skip
  actions if their dependencies are not available.
  </item>
<tag>9.1.1</tag>
  <item>GNU/Hurd systems are allowed <file>/hurd</file>
  and <file>/servers</file> directories in the root filesystem.
  </item>
<tag>9.1.1</tag>
  <item>Packages installing to architecture-specific subdirectories of
  <file>/usr/lib</file> must use the value returned by
  <prgn>dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_MULTIARCH</prgn>, not by
  <prgn>dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE</prgn>; this is a path change
  on i386 architectures and a no-op for other architectures.
  </item>
<tag>virtual</tag>
  <item><tt>mailx</tt> is now a virtual package provided by packages that
  install <prgn>/usr/bin/mailx</prgn> and implement at least the
  POSIX-required interface.
  </item>
</taglist></p>

<sect id="3.9.1.0"> Version 3.9.1.0
<p>

Released July, 2010.

</p><p><taglist>
<tag>3.2.1</tag>
  <item>Date-based version components should be given as the four-digit
  year, two-digit month, and then two-digit day, but may have embedded
  punctuation.
  </item>
<tag>3.9</tag>
  <item>Maintainer scripts must pass <tt>--package</tt>
  to <prgn>dpkg-divert</prgn> when creating or removing diversions and
  must not use <tt>--local</tt>.
  </item>
<tag>4.10</tag>
  <item>Only <prgn>dpkg-gencontrol</prgn> supports variable substitution.
  <prgn>dpkg-genchanges</prgn> (for <file>*.changes</file>)
  and <prgn>dpkg-source</prgn> (for <file>*.dsc</file>) do not.
  </item>
<tag>7.1</tag>
  <item>Architecture restrictions and wildcards are also allowed in binary
  package relationships provided that the binary package is not
  architecture-independent.
  </item>
<tag>7.4</tag>
  <item><tt>Conflicts</tt> and <tt>Breaks</tt> should only be used when
  there are file conflicts or one package breaks the other, not just
  because two packages provide similar functionality but don't interfere.
  </item>
<tag>8.1</tag>
  <item>The SONAME of a library should change whenever the ABI of the
  library changes in a way that isn't backward-compatible.  It should not
  change if the library ABI changes are backward-compatible.  Discourage
  bundling shared libraries together in one package.
  </item>
<tag>8.4</tag>
  <item>Ada Library Information (<file>*.ali</file>) files must be
  installed read-only.
  </item>
<tag>8.6.1, 8.6.2, 8.6.5</tag>
  <item>Packages should normally not include a <file>shlibs.local</file>
  file since we now have complete <file>shlibs</file> coverage.
  </item>
<tag>8.6.3</tag>
  <item>The SONAME of a library may instead be of the
  form <tt><var>name</var>-<var>major-version</var>.so</tt>.
  </item>
<tag>10.2</tag>
  <item>Libtool <file>.la</file> files should not be installed for public
  libraries.  If they're required (for <tt>libltdl</tt>, for instance),
  the <tt>dependency_libs</tt> setting should be emptied.  Library
  packages historically including <file>.la</file> files must continue to
  include them (with <tt>dependency_libs</tt> emptied) until all libraries
  that depend on that library have removed or emptied
  their <file>.la</file> files.
  </item>
<tag>10.2</tag>
  <item>Libraries no longer need to be built with <tt>-D_REENTRANT</tt>,
  which was an obsolete LinuxThreads requirement.  Instead, say explicitly
  that libraries should be built with threading support and to be
  thread-safe if the library supports this.
  </item>
<tag>10.4</tag>
  <item><file>/bin/sh</file> scripts may assume that <prgn>kill</prgn>
  supports an argument of <tt>-<var>signal</var></tt>,
  that <prgn>kill</prgn> and <prgn>trap</prgn> support the numeric signals
  listed in the XSI extension, and that signal 13 (SIGPIPE) can be trapped
  with <prgn>trap</prgn>.
  </item>
<tag>10.8</tag>
  <item>Use of <file>/etc/logrotate.d/<var>package</var></file> for
  logrotate rules is now recommended.
  </item>
<tag>10.9</tag>
  <item>Control information files should be owned by <tt>root:root</tt>
  and either mode 644 or mode 755.
  </item>
<tag>11.4, 11.8.3, 11.8.4</tag>
  <item>Packages providing alternatives for <prgn>editor</prgn>,
  <prgn>pager</prgn>, <prgn>x-terminal-emulator</prgn>, or
  <prgn>x-window-manager</prgn> should also provide a slave alternative
  for the corresponding manual page.
  </item>
<tag>11.5</tag>
  <item>Cgi-bin executable files may be installed in subdirectories
  of <file>/usr/lib/cgi-bin</file> and web servers should serve out
  executables in those subdirectories.
  </item>
<tag>12.5</tag>
  <item>The GPL version 1 is now included in common-licenses and should be
  referenced from there instead of included in the <file>copyright</file>
  file.
  </item>
</taglist></p>

<sect id="3.9.0.0"> Version 3.9.0.0
<p>

Released June, 2010.

</p><p><taglist>
<tag>4.4, 5.6.15</tag>
  <item>The required format for the date in a changelog entry and in the
  Date control field is now precisely specified.
  </item>
<tag>5.1</tag>
  <item>A control paragraph must not contain more than one instance of a
  particular field name.
  </item>
<tag>5.4, 5.5, 5.6.24</tag>
  <item>The <tt>Checksums-Sha1</tt> and <tt>Checksums-Sha256</tt> fields
  in <file>*.dsc</file> and <file>*.changes</file> files are now
  documented and recommended.
  </item>
<tag>5.5, 5.6.16</tag>
  <item>The <tt>Format</tt> field of <file>.changes</file> files is now
  1.8.  The <tt>Format</tt> field syntax for source
  package <file>.dsc</file> files allows a subtype in parentheses, and it
  is used for a different purpose than the <tt>Format</tt> field
  for <file>.changes</file> files.
  </item>
<tag>5.6.2</tag>
  <item>The syntax of the <tt>Maintainer</tt> field is now must rather
  than should.
  </item>
<tag>5.6.3</tag>
  <item>The comma separating entries in <tt>Uploaders</tt> is now must
  rather than should.
  </item>
<tag>5.6.8, 7.1, 11.1.1</tag>
  <item>Architecture wildcards may be used in addition to specific
  architectures in <file>debian/control</file> and <file>*.dsc</file>
  Architecture fields, and in architecture restrictions in build
  relationships.
  </item>
<tag>6.3</tag>
  <item>Maintainer scripts are no longer guaranteed to run with a
  controlling terminal and must be able to fall back to noninteractive
  behavior (debconf handles this).  Maintainer scripts may abort if there
  is no controlling terminal and no reasonable default for a high-priority
  question, but should avoid this if possible.
  </item>
<tag>7.3, 7.6.1</tag>
  <item><tt>Breaks</tt> should be used with <tt>Replaces</tt> for moving
  files between packages.
  </item>
<tag>7.4</tag>
  <item><tt>Breaks</tt> should normally be used instead
  of <tt>Conflicts</tt> for transient issues and moving files between
  packages.  New documentation of when each should be used.
  </item>
<tag>7.5</tag>
  <item>Use <tt>Conflicts</tt> with <tt>Provides</tt> if only one provider
  of a virtual facility can be installed at a time.
  </item>
<tag>8.4</tag>
  <item>All shared library development files are no longer required to be
  in the <tt>-dev</tt> package, only be available when the <tt>-dev</tt>
  package is installed.  This allows the <tt>-dev</tt> package to be split
  as long as it depends on the additional packages.
  </item>
<tag>9.2.2</tag>
  <item>The UID range of user accounts is extended to 1000-59999.
  </item>
<tag>9.3.2, 10.4</tag>
  <item><file>init.d</file> scripts are a possible exception from the
  normal requirement to use <tt>set -e</tt> in each shell script.
  </item>
<tag>12.5</tag>
  <item>The UCB BSD license was removed from the list of licenses that
  should be referenced from <file>/usr/share/common-licenses/BSD</file>.
  It should instead be included directly
  in <file>debian/copyright</file>, although it will still be in
  common-licenses for the time being.
  </item>
<tag>debconf</tag>
  <item><tt>SETTITLE</tt> is now documented (it has been supported for
  some time).  <tt>SETTITLE</tt> is like <tt>TITLE</tt> but takes a
  template instead of a string to allow translation.
  </item>
<tag>perl</tag>
  <item><package>perl-base</package> now
  provides <package>perlapi-<var>abiname</var></package> instead of a
  package based solely on the Perl version.  Perl packages must now depend
  on <package>perlapi-$Config{debian_abi}</package>, falling back
  on <tt>$Config{version}</tt> if <tt>$Config{debian_abi}</tt> is not set.
  </item>
<tag>perl</tag>
  <item>Packages using <file>Makefile.PL</file> should use
  <tt>DESTDIR</tt> rather than <tt>PREFIX</tt> to install into the package
  staging area.  <tt>PREFIX</tt> only worked due to a Debian-local patch.

  <item>The Binary field may span multiple lines.
  </item>
<tag>10.2</tag>
  <item>Shared library packages are no longer allowed to install libraries
  in a non-standard location and modify <file/ld.so.conf/.  Packages
  should either be installed in a standard library directory or packages
  using them should be built with RPATH.
  </item>
<tag>11.8.7</tag>
  <item>Installation directories for X programs have been clarified.
  Packages are no longer required to pre-depend on x11-common before
  installing into <file>/usr/include/X11</file>

  </item>
<tag>12.1</tag>
  <item>Manual pages are no longer required to contain only characters

<tag>12.1</tag>
  <item>Localized man pages should either be kept up-to-date with

  with warning text or by showing missing or changed portions in the
  original language.
  </item>
<tag>12.2</tag>
  <item>install-info is now handled via triggers so packages no

  should now have directory sections and entries in the document.
  Packages containing info documents should add a dependency to
  support partial upgrades.

  else is necessary.
<tag>4.9.1, 10.1</tag>
<item>Standardized the format of DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.  Specified permitted
  characters for tags, required that tags be whitespace-separated,
  allowed packages to assume non-conflicting tags, and required
  unknown flags be ignored.                                
<tag>4.9.1</tag>

  modification.  This file may also be used to document packaging a
  new upstream release and any other complexity of the Debian build

  named in Breaks is deconfigured first.  This field should not be

<tag>8.1, 8.2</tag>
<item>Clarify which files should go into a shared library package, into a
  separate package, or into the -dev package.  Suggest -tools instead
  of -runtime for runtime support programs, since that naming is more
  common in Debian.

  long-obsolete.           
<tag>12.1</tag>
<item>Manual pages in locale-specific directories should use either the
  legacy encoding for that directory or UTF-8.  Country names should
  not be included in locale-specific manual page directories unless
  indicating a significant difference in the language.  All
  characters in the manual page source should be representable in the
  legacy encoding for a locale even if the man page is encoded in
  UTF-8.

<tag>5.1, 5.6.3</tag>
<item>All fields, apart from the Uploaders field, in the control file
  are supposed to be a single logical line, which may be spread
  over multiple physical  lines (newline followed by space is
  elided).  However, any parser for the control file must allow
  the Uploaders field to be spread over multiple physical lines
  as well, to prepare for future changes.
<tag>10.4</tag>
<item>When scripts are installed into a directory in the system
  PATH, the script name should not include an extension that
  denotes the scripting language currently used to implement it.

  chapter Debian Archive, from which two new chapters were split out,
  Binary packages and Source packages. What remained was reordered
  properly, that is, some sects became sects etc.

<item>Several sections that were redundant, crufty or simply not designed
  with any sort of vision, were rearranged according to the formula that
  everything should be either in the same place or properly interlinked.

<tag>9.3.4</tag>
<item><file>/etc/rc.boot</file> has been deprecated in favour of
  <file>/etc/rcS.d</file>.  (Packages should not be touching this directory,

<tag>9.3.3</tag>
<item>update-rc.d is now the <em>only</em> allowable way of accessing the
  <file>/etc/rc?.d/[SK]??*</file> links.  Any scripts which manipulate them
  directly must be changed to use update-rc.d instead.  (This is
  because the file-rc package handles this information in an
  incompatible way.)

    gap.

    changelog name to the Debian mandated name.
