        <heading>Background</heading>
        <p>
          MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, RFC 1521) is
          a mechanism for encoding files and datastreams and providing
          meta-information about them, in particular their type (e.g. audio
          or video) and format (e.g. PNG, HTML, MP3).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Registration of MIME type handlers allows programs like mail
          user agents and web browsers to to invoke these handlers to
          view, edit or display MIME types they don't support directly.
        </p>

	<heading>MIME support implementation</heading>
	<p>
          The <package>mime-support</package> package provides the
          <prgn>update-mime</prgn> program which allows packages to
          register programs that can show, compose, edit or print
          MIME types.
	</p>

	<p>
          Packages containing such programs must register them
          with <prgn>update-mime</prgn> as documented in <manref
          name="update-mime" section="8">. They should <em>not</em> depend
          on, recommend, or suggest <prgn>mime-support</prgn>. Instead,
          they should just put something like the following in the
          <tt>postinst</tt> and <tt>postrm</tt> scripts:

          <example> 
  if [ -x /usr/sbin/update-mime ]; then
      update-mime
  fi
          </example>
