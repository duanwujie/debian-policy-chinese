              AUTHORITATIVE LIST OF VIRTUAL PACKAGE NAMES

                            October 1999


Below is an authoritative list of virtual package names currently
in-use or proposed and not objected to.  Please check the list below
for things relevant to your packages.

New packages MUST use virtual package names where appropriate (this
includes making new ones - read on).

Packages MUST NOT use virtual package names (except privately, amongst
a cooperating group of packages) unless they have been agreed upon and
appear in this list.

The latest version of this file can be found in
        doc/package-developer/virtual-package-names-list.text
on your local Debian FTP site.

The procedure for updating the list is as follows:

1. Post to debian-devel saying what names you intend to use or what
   other changes you wish to make, and file a wish list bug against the
   package debian-policy.

2. Wait a few days for comment (some of the comments may be on the
   debian-policy list, if you are not subscribed, ask for mail to be CC'd
   to you).

3. Mail the maintainer of the virtual package name list (which is the
   Debian Policy list <debian-policy@lists.debian.org>) notifying them
   of the consensus reached (or your suggestions if noone objected).
   Please update the bug report at the same time (retitling the bug to
   [ACCEPTED] ....

   Please include a proposed brief description of the new virtual name(s)
   for the list.  The list maintainer will then post the new list to
   debian-devel and upload it to the FTP site.

4. Go and use the new or changed names.
