		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.7--patch-20
		  Typo fixes. 

	* policy.sgml (INSTALL_DIR):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.7--patch-20
		  typo fix: s/s/a/ 
		  Add "is"
		  Clarify the fact that most fields can have multi line
		  values in control files, apart from the Uploaders field.
		  Since the packaging system can handle multi line fields
		  anyway, it does not make sense to prohibit them in
		  policy. 
		  Mention the need to have a copyright file in the source
		  package section as well.

	* policy.sgml (INSTALL_DIR):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.7--patch-17

		  standard directive that shared libraries must be
		  compiled with  -fPIC, and static libraries without,
		  added the protocol to be followed  when doing so. 

2006-04-26  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* policy.sgml:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.7--patch-14
		  Added an informative footnote to document the fact that
		  while dpkg does handle changes to file
		  ownership/permissions on upgrade, ownership or
		  permissions on directories already on the system are not
		  modified. 
	  (Version): Disambiguate the overloaded use of section for main,
		  contrib, non-free as well as for admin, lib,devel,
		  etc. Various fixes based on a 1999 nit picking message

	* policy-process.sgml:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--patch-16
		  Minor typo fix 

	* upgrading-checklist.html (issue):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--patch-15
		  Document the fact that cgi executable location is
		  changing, and that web servers need to provide script
		  aliases.  
	  (issue):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--patch-15
		  mentioned the change to FHS 2.3 
	  (issue):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--patch-15
		  When scripts are installed into into a  directory in the
		  system PATH, the script name should not include
		  aextension that denotes the scripting language currently
		  used to implement it.

	* policy.sgml (http):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--patch-15
		  [PENDING AMENDMENT 20/01/2000] Splitting cgi-bin. Since
		  most web servers do include this, it seems like it is
		  about time. 
		  (Version):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--patch-15
		  Changed the default version we refer to in
		  policy to version 2.3, and added in specific
		  exceptions t the new version of the FHS. 
	  (Package):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--patch-15
		  Mention that all fileds, except the Uploaders, are
		  supposed to be a single logical line, which may be
		  spread over multiple physical lines (newline followed by
		  space is elided). Also mention that anything  parsing
		  the control file must allow for a multi-line uploaders
		  field. 
	  (INSTALL_DIR):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--patch-15
		  When scripts are installed into into a  directory in the
		  system PATH, the script name should not include an
		  extensionthat denotes the scripting language currently
		  used to  implement it. 
		  No longer specify the full list of common license
		  files,since the list gets out dated with newer
		  versions of license files. 
		  Punt to dpkg-architecture to providing legal
			  architecture strings, since that's what is used
			  by everyone anyway.  The version in policy was
			  wrong, but that s=does not seem to  have
			  hindered anyone, which indicates that this
			  policy directive was uneeded. Now the
			  dpkg-architecture list is deemed authoritative,
			  which  it is, and the format is in an
			  informative foot note. 
		  Make use of invoke-rc.d mandatory when calling initscripts. 
		  Changed various X related paths to reflect the move over
			  to Xorg, and away from /usr/X11R6.

		  Mention config files, with a proper reference in the
		  maintainer scripts area

	* perl-policy.sgml:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--patch-8
		  Typo fix (as -> at) 

	* policy.sgml:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--patch-6
		  Policy does not describe the current tasksel/tasks
		  situation very well. After correctiong the errors, and
		  eliminating obsolete paragraphs, therewas nothing that a
		  general maintainer needs to do about tasksel task
		  selection, it makes no sense to have this section in
		  policy. removed.  
		  One of the examples listed in B.1 is not correct and
		  does not work. Three problems.  One is that 'xof' does
		  not write to stdout, 'xOf' does.  Another is
		  that filenames in debs start with "./" and so
		  the listed file will not be matched.  Third is
		  that f needs a filename and "-" is usually the
		  tradition, but hyphen problems with fonts
		  probably caused it to be dropped.  That last
		  probably needs a special crosscheck to make sure
		  it makes it through the formatting. 
	  (INSTALL):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--patch-6
		  typo fix.
		  Fixed up the description, and summary, of the maintainer
		  scripts call sequence. 
		  remove obsolete footnote statements about UTF-8
		  Erase mention of obsolete non-US section
		  (Package):
			  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--patch-6
			  The format field of .dsc is now mandatory

		  includes: scheme-r4rs scheme-r5rs scheme-ieee-11878-1900
		  scheme-srfi-0 scheme-srfi-7 scheme-srfi-55 
	  (Format):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--patch-5

	* upgrading-checklist.html (issue):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--patch-1
		  Document the fact that HTTP servers are recommended to
		  provide an /image alias for packages to share images
		  with the server.

	* policy.sgml (http):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--base-0
		  The proposal states that /usr/share/images/<package> and
		  can be referred to as
		  http://localhost/images/<package>/<filename. This allows
		  a simple solution to making images in packages
		  accessible to the HTTP server without having to resort
		  to symbolic links. 

		Various spelling errors were also corrected in a spell
		check run. 

		  Provide the URL for the down-loadable version of policy
		  documents in various formats, instead of just providing
		  a link. 

	* virtual-package-names-list.txt (Format):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/debian-policy--devel--3.6--base-0
		  Removed aspell-dictionary, as  requested by the package
		  maintainers, as it is no longer in use.
