Note on file format
===================

These files are in .dia because that is the format in which they were
obtained from marga's website, and they have not been edited since
they became part of the Policy Manual.  We might want to convert them
to .svg before making further modifications.

The .autosave file was also published online by marga, and is included
here so that this repository may serve as a backup of marga's original
work.
