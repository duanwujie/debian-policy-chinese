Maintainer script flowcharts
============================

The flowcharts [#]_ included in this appendix use the following
conventions:

-  maintainer scripts and their arguments are within boxes;

-  actions carried out external to the scripts are in italics; and

-  the ``dpkg`` status of the package at the end of the run are in bold
   type.
