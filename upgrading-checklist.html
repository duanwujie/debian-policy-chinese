<h1>Policy checklist for upgrading your packages</h1>

<h2>About the checklist</h2>

The checklist below has been created to simplify the upgrading process
of old packages. Note, that this list is not `official.' If you have
doubts about a certain topic, if you need more details, or if you
think some other package does not comply with policy, please refer to
the Policy Manual.
<p>

Here is how the check list works: Check out which policy version your
packages complies with currently. Than move upwards until the top and
check which of the items on the list might concern your package. If an
item does not give you enough details, please check out the Policy
Manual.
