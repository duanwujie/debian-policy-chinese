    <title>Policy checklist for upgrading your packages</title>
  </head>

    <h1>Policy checklist for upgrading your packages</h1>

    <h2>About the checklist</h2>

<p>
The checklist below has been created to simplify the upgrading process
of old packages.  Note that this list is not `official'; it simply
gives an indication of what has changed and whether you are likely to
need to make changes to your package in light of this.  If you have
doubts about a certain topic, if you need more details, or if you
think some other package does not comply with policy, please refer to
the Policy Manual itself.  All of the changes from version 3.0.0
onwards indicate which section of the Policy Manual discusses the
issue: [3.4] means section 3.4.  The section numbering changed when
the packaging manual was incorporated into policy; the section numbers
used below refer to the current version.
</p>

<p>
Here is how the check list works: Check which policy version your
package complies with currently (indicated in the "Standards-Version"
field of the source package).  Then move upwards until the top and
check which of the items on the list might concern your package.  Note
which sections of policy discuss this, and then check out the Policy
Manual for details.  If you are upgrading from Policy version < 2.5.0,
it may be easier to check through the whole of policy instead of
picking your way through this list.
</p>

<h2>The checklist</h2>

<pre>
3.5.8.0                    Xyz XY

     - It is no longer necessary to keep a log of changes to the upstream
       sources in the copyright file. Instead, all such changes should be
       documented in the changelog file. [13.7]

3.5.7.0                    Aug 02

     - Packages no longer have to ask permission to call MAKEDEV in
       postinst, merely notifying the user ought to be enough. [11.6]
     - cryptographic software may now be included in the main
       archive. [2.1.5]
     - task packages are now not permitted; tasks are now created by a
       special Tasks: field in the control file. [2.3.8]
     - window managers that support netwm now can added 20 points when
       they add themselves as an alternative for
       /usr/bin/x-window-manager [12.8.4]
     - There are new rules for build-indep/build-arch targets and
       there is a new Build-Depend-Indep semantic. These were actually
       introduced in 3.5.6, but I forgot to mention them here. [7]
     - The default compilation options have now changed, one should
       provide debugging symbols in all cases, and optionally step
       back optimization to -O0, depending on the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
       environment variable. [11.1]
     - Added mention of build-arch, build-indep, etc, in describing
       the relationships with `Build-Depends', `Build-Conflicts',
       `Build-Depends-Indep', and `Build-Conflicts-Indep'. May need to
       review the new rules.  [7.6, 5.2]
     - Changed rules on how, and when, to invoke ldconfig in maintiner
       scripts. Long rationale. [9]

3.5.6.0                    Jul 01

     - Emacs and TeX are no longer mandated by policy to be priority
       standard packages [2.2]
     - Programs that access docs need to do so via /usr/share/doc, and
       not via /usr/doc/ as was the policy previously [12.5]
     - Putting documentation in /usr/doc versus /usr/share/doc is now
       a ``serious'' policy violation
     - For web servers, one should not provide non-local access to the
       /usr/share/doc hierarchy. If one can't provide access controls for
       the //localhost/doc/ directory, then it is preferred that one
       ask permission to expose that information during the install [12.5]


3.5.5.0                    May 01

     - Manpages should not rely on header information to have
       alternative manpage names available; it should only use
       symlinks or .so pages to do this [13.1]
     - [Clarified note in 3.5.3.0 upgrading checklist regarding
        examples and templates: this refers only to those examples used
        by scripts; see section 11.7.3 for the whole story]
     - Included a new section 11.9.1 describing the use of
       dpkg-statoverride; this does not have the weight of policy
     - Clarify Standards-Version: you don't need to rebuild your
       packages just to change the Standards-Version!
     - Plugins are no longer bound by all the rules of shared
       libraries [11.2]
     - X Windows related things:
       * Clarification of priority levels of X Window System related
         packages [12.8.1]
       * Rules for defining x-terminal-emulator improved [12.8.3]
       * X Font policy rewritten: you must read this if you provide
         fonts for the X Window System [12.8.5]
       * Packages must not ship /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/ [12.8.6]
       * X-related packages should usually use the regular FHS
         locations; imake-using packages are exempted from this [12.8.7]
       * OpenMotif linked binaries have the same rules as
         OSF/Motif-linked ones [12.8.8]


3.5.4.0                    Apr 01

     - The system-wide mail directory is now /var/mail, no longer
       /var/spool/mail.  Any packages accessing the mail spool should
       access it via /var/mail and include a suitable Depends field;
       details in [12.6]
     - The perl policy is now part of Debian policy proper. Perl
       programs and modules should follow the current Perl policy
       [12.9; perl-policy]


3.5.3.0                    Apr 01

     - Build-Depends arch syntax has been changed to be less
       ambiguous. This should not affect any current packages [7.1]
     - Examples and templates files for use by scripts should now live
       in /usr/share/&lt;package&gt; or /usr/lib/&lt;package&gt;, with
       symbolic links from /usr/share/doc//&lt;package&gt;/examples as
       needed [11.7.3]


3.5.2.0                    Feb 01

     - X app-defaults directory has moved from
       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults to /etc/X11/app-defaults [12.8.6]


3.5.1.0                    Feb 01

     - dpkg-shlibdeps now uses objdump, so shared libraries have to be
       run through dpkg-shlibdeps as well as executables [9.1]


3.5.0.0                    Jan 01

     - Font packages for the X Window System must now declare a
       dependency on xutils (>= 4.0.2) [12.8.5]


3.2.1.1                    Jan 01

     - Daemon startup scripts in /etc/init.d/ should not contain
       modifiable parameters; these should be moved to a file in
       /etc/default/; see [10.3.2] for details
     - Files in /usr/share/doc must not be referenced by any
       program.  If such files are needed, they must be placed in
       /usr/share/&lt;package&gt;/, and symbolic links created as required
       in /usr/share/doc/&lt;package&gt;/ [13.3]
     - Much of the packaging manual has now been imported into the
       policy document


3.2.1.0                    Aug 00

     - A package of priority standard or higher may provide two
       binaries, one compiled with support for the X Window System,
       and the other without [12.8.1]


3.2.0.0                    Aug 00

     - By default executables should not be built with the debugging
       option -g. Instead, it is recommended to support building the
       package with debugging information optionally.  Details in [11.1]
     - Policy for packages where the upstream uses HTML changelog
       files has been expanded.  In short, a plain text changelog file
       should always be generated for the upstream changes [13.8]
     - Please note that the new release of the X window system (4.x)
       shall probably need sweeping changes in policy
     - Policy for packages providing the following X-based features
       has been codified:
       - X server (virtual package xserver) [12.8.2]
       - X terminal emulator (virtual package x-terminal-emulator) [12.8.3]
       - X window manager (virtual package x-window-manager, and
         /usr/bin/x-window-manager alternative, with priority
         calculation guidelines) [12.8.4]
       - X fonts (this section has been written from scratch) [12.8.5]
       - X application defaults [12.8.6]
     - Policy for packages using the X Window System and FHS issues
       has been clarified; see [12.8.7]
     - No package may contain or make hard links to conffiles [11.7.3]
     - Noted that newer dpkg versions do not require extreme care in
       always creating the shared lib before the symlink, so the unpack
       order be correct [9]


3.1.1.0                    Nov 99

     - Correction to semantics of architecture lists in Build-Depends
       etc.  Should not affect many packages [7.1]


3.1.0.0                    Oct 99

     - /usr/doc/&lt;package&gt; has to be a symlink pointing to
       /usr/share/doc/&lt;package&gt;, to be maintained by postinst
       and prerm scripts.  Details are in [13.4]
     - Introduced source dependencies (Build-Depends, etc.) [7.1, 7.6]
     - /etc/rc.boot has been deprecated in favour of /etc/rcS.d.
       (Packages should not be touching this directory, but should use
       update-rc.d instead) [10.3.4]
     - update-rc.d is now the *only* allowable way of accessing the
       /etc/rc?.d/[SK]??* links.  Any scripts which manipulate them
       directly must be changed to use update-rc.d instead.  (This is
       because the file-rc package handles this information in an
       incompatible way.) [10.3.3]
     - Architecture-specific examples go in /usr/lib/&lt;package&gt;/examples
       with symlinks from /usr/share/doc/&lt;package&gt;/examples/* or from
       /usr/share/doc/&lt;package&gt;/examples itself [13.7]
     - Updated FHS to a 2.1 draft; this reverts /var/state to
       /var/lib [10.1.1]
     - Added MIME sub-policy document [10.7; mime-policy]
     - VISUAL is allowed as a (higher priority) alternative to EDITOR [12.4]
     - Modified liblockfile description, which affects
       mailbox-accessing programs.  Please see the policy document for
       details [12.6]
     - If a package provides a changelog in HTML format, a text-only
       version should also be included.  (Such a version may be prepared
       using lynx -dump -nolist.) [13.8]
     - Description of how to handle version numbers based on dates
       added [4.1]


3.0.1.0                    Jul 99

    -  Added the clarification that the .la files are essential for the
       packages using libtool's libltdl library, in which case the
       .la files must go in the run-time library package [11.2]


3.0.0.0                    Jun 99

    - Debian formally moves from the FSSTND to the FHS. This is a
      major change, and the implications of this move are probably
      not all known. [10.1]
    - Only 3 digits of the Standards version need be included in
      control files, though all four digits are still permitted. [2.4.1]
    - The location of the GPL has changed to
      /usr/share/common-licenses. This may require changing the
      copyright files to point to the correct location of the GPL and
      other major licenses [13.6]
    - Packages that use libtool to create shared libraries must
      include the .la files in the -dev packages [11.2]
    - Use logrotate to rotate log files [11.8]
    - section 5.8 has been rewritten (Programs for the X Window
      System) [now 12.8]
    - There is now an associated menu policy, in a separate document,
      that carries the full weight of Debian policy [10.6; menu-policy]
    - Programs which need to modify the files /var/run/utmp,
      /var/log/wtmp and /var/log/lastlog must be installed setgid utmp [12.3]


2.5.0.0                         Oct 98

  Policy Manual:
    - Rearranged the manual to create a new Section 4, Files
      + Section 3.3 ("Files") was moved to Section 4. The Sections
        that  were Section 4 and Section 5 were  moved down to become
        Section 5 and Section 6.
      + What was Section 5.5 ("Log files") is now a subsection of the
        new Section 4 ("Files"), becoming section 4.8, placed after
        "Configuration files", moving the Section 4.8 ("Permissions
        and owners") to Section 4.9.  All subsections of the old
        Section 5 after 5.5  were moved down to fill in the number
        gap.
    - Modified the section about changelog files to accommodate
      upstream changelogs which were formatted as HTML/ These
      upstream changelog files should now be accessible as
      /usr/doc/package/changelog.html.gz
      + Symlinks are permissible to link the real, or upstream,
        changelog name to the Debian mandated name.
    - Clarified that HTML documentation should be present in some
      package, though not necessarily the main binary package.
    - Corrected all references to the location of the copyright
      files. The correct location is /usr/doc/package/copyright
    - Ratified the architecture specification strings to cater to the
      HURD.

2.4.1.0                         Apr 98

  Policy Manual:
    - Updated section 3.3.5 Symbolic links:
      + symbolic links within a toplevel directory should be relative,

        (cf., Policy Weekly Issue#6, topic 2)

    - Updated section 4.9 Games:
      + manpages for games should be installed in /usr/man/man6
        (cf., Policy Weekly Issue#6, topic 3)

  Packaging Manual:
    - Updated prefix of chapter 12, Shared Libraries:

      + scripts including bashisms have to specify /bin/bash as
        interpreter
      + scripts which create files in world-writable directories
        (e.g., in /tmp) should use tempfile or mktemp for creating
        the directory

    - Updated section 3.3.5 Symbolic Links:
      + symbolic links referencing compressed files must have the same
        file extension as the referenced file

    - Updated section 3.3.6 Device files:
      + /dev/tty* serial devices should be used instead of /dev/cu*

    - Updated section 3.4.2 Writing the scripts [in /etc/init.d]:
      + all /etc/init.d scripts have to provide the following options:
        start, stop, restart, force-reload
      + the reload option is optional and must never stop and restart
        the service

    - Updated section 3.5 Cron jobs:
      + cron jobs that need to be executed more often than daily should
        be installed into /etc/cron.d

    - Updated section 3.7 Menus:
      + removed section about how to register HTML docs to `menu'
        (the corresponding section in 4.4, Web servers and applications,
        has been removed in policy 2.2.0.0 already, so this one was
        obsolete)

    - New section 3.8 Keyboard configuration:
      + details about how the backspace and delete keys should be
        handled

    - New section 3.9 Environment variables:
