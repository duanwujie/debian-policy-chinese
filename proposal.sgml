      <heading>Introduction, and adminstrivia</heading>
      <p>
	This is a proposal for creating a process through which the
	Debian Policy documents are to be maintained and updated, it
	sets forth the processes, and also calls for the creation of a
	team responsible for the task of updating policy, however,
	this team does not act as author or editor of Policy it self,
	that is the task of the Debian Policy mailing list.

	<heading>Deadline for tabling the discussion</heading>
	<p>	  
	  I decided to use the suggested "usual" period of two weeks
	  for this proposal. Therefore, this proposal needs to be
	  acted upon before August the 22nd, 1998.

	  Well, since Michael Alan Dorman and Richard Braakman have
	  volunteered to serve on the policy maintainer team, I think
	  they have no objection to being seconds.<enumlist>

	<heading>The policy maintainers team</heading>
	<p>
	  I propose we select/install a group of people who have
	  access to the CVS repository for the Policy documents;
	  however, this set of people behave more like maintainers
	  rather than authors/editors. This group does not create
	  policy, not does it excersice editorial control, Policy is
	  decided "upstream".  The group that decides on policy should
	  be the group of developers on the Debian-policy mailing
	  lists, which is how it was always done; so the group of
	  policy maintainers have no real power over policy. Since
	  they would have access to the CVS repository I guess it is
	  desirable that the people so appointed be ``mature'',
	  however that is determined.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I think that since the policy maintainers have no special
	  powers, there is no need to restrict their participation in
	  the discussion. We do need to have at least 4-5 people on
	  the job, preferably closer to 8, so that policy does not
	  languish when any maintainer goes missing (we do need
	  vacations, you know, once in a while), and since little
	  creative power is vested in the maintainers, we do not need
	  a central control. And the archives of the list can be used
	  as a record of the action decided upon even if all
	  maintainers are away at some time.
	</p>
      </sect>
      <sect>
	<heading>The CVS Repository</heading>
	<p>
	  There should be a repository set up on
	  <tt>cvs.debian.org</tt> for this, with the people on the
	  policy maintainer team having write access to it. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  The repository should contain all the packages under the
	  control of the team, and also should have anrea where the
	  weekly status document is kep; once the document is under
	  CVS, it should be a simple matter to script exporting the
	  document out to a place where the web server can serve it,
	  as well as create the weekly posting to
	  <tt>debian-poilcy</tt> and <tt>debian-devel</tt> mailing
	  lists. This document could also be kept under CVS then.</p>

	<heading>Proposing amendments to the Policy</heading>
	<p>
	  Unlike before, when the policy editor gathered in issues
	  which, in his view, were candidates for inclusion in policy,
	  I propose that issues are brought up in the policy group,
	  and, if the initial discussion warrants it, any developer,
	  with at least two(?) seconds can formally propose as a
	  policy amendment.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The rationale behind the requirement for senconders is that
	  it would<enumlist>
	    <item>
	      <p>
		Encourage people to test the waters on the policy
		mailing list, and this could help create an proposal
		with a better chance of success</p>
	    </item>
	    <item>
	      <p>
		Prevent frivoulous or ill concieved proposals from
		wasting peoples time (If the proposal does not even
		convince two developers, surely this is not ready for
		inclusion in Policy?)</p>
	    </item>
	  </enumlist>
	</p>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Notifications and status reports</heading>
	  <p>
	    Periodically, possibly weekly, a summary of current policy
	    topics can be posted to the Developers mailing list, as
	    well as to the policy mailing list. The list of topics
	    should be posted on the web as well.</p>
	  <p>
	    If the current topic list is kept in CVS, then a simple
	    script could handle both the tasks, and all the
	    maintainers need do is keep the CVS repository up do
	    date. If the Bug tracking system is used, this may be
	    semi-automated too.</p>
	  <p>
	    Amendments to policy that have been accepted by the policy
	    group shall also be part of the notification.</p>

      </sect>
      <sect>
	<heading>Deadlines for tabling discussions</heading>
	<p>
	  It has been observed in the past that discussions on the
	  mailing list devolve into endless arguments. In order to get
	  away from the debating society aspect, at the time of the
	  formal proposal,a deadline can be set (probably by the
	  proposer, since they are likely to have an idea how
	  contentious the discussion is likely to be) for ending
	  discussion on the issue, which should rarely be less than 10
	  days, and typically two weeks or so. I hope that a hard
	  minimum period need not be set, and that the proposers would
	  be reasonable, and not set too short or too long a time for
	  discussion.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If a consensus is reached by the policy group, then the
	  maintianers shall enter the amendment into the Policy
	  document, announce the inclusion in the periodic report, and
	  release a new version.</p>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Extensions to deadlines?</heading>
	  <p>
	    If a deadline is approaching, and the discussion s almost
	    concluded (in other words, it has not reached an impasse),
	    and the consensus on the policy group is that an extension
	    of a week would resolve the issues better, a one-time
	    extention could be granted. Care should be taken in
	    exercising this option, since abusing this would merely
	    postpone closures. </p>
	</sect1>
      </sect>
      <sect>
	<heading>Deadlock resolution</heading>
	<p>
	  Formerly, arriving at a consensus was the only way to amend
	  Policy. That worked well when the Project was small,
	  however, we have aparently grown out of that phase, and even
	  the policy mailing list has grown more fractious than in the
	  days of yore. We now need a formal process of deadlock
	  resolution, and we need to recognize that on non-technical
	  issues a small minority should not always hold up deployment
	  of policy.</p>
	<p>
	  If a consensus is not reached, (or if someone submits a
	  formal objection to the proposal) and the end of the
	  discussion period is near, then one is faced with a dilemma.
	</p>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Impasse on technical issues</heading>
	  <p>
	    On technical issues, popularity is a bad way of arriving
	    at conclusions. Hopefully, the policy group would arrive
	    at a consensus on their own. If that fails to happen, or
	    if there is a formal objection raised on the issue, and
	    the issue is a technical one, then the technical committee
	    may be consulted. This should be a rare occurrence. </p>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Non technical and subjective disagreements</heading>
	  <p>
	    However, if the issue is non-technical and subjective,
	    then a vote of the developers may be taken (USENET voting
	    software should be available all over the place, right?);
	    and a super-majority of 75% is needed to carry the
	    amendment through. Failing the super-majority, the issue
	    should be shelved. It may be re-submitted as a a fresh
	    proposal after a suitable cooling off period (which should
	    be no less than a month, typically three months being
	    desirable, unless there are significant new
	    developments). (Demote bug, if the BTS is being used)</p>
	</sect1>
      </sect>
      <sect>
	<heading>Using the bug tracking system</heading>
	<p>
	  A fascinating sub proposal has been that we use the bug
	  tracking system to track policy amendments in progress. If
	  this is used, we may intiate discussions in the policy group
	  by filing wish-list bugs (note: this should be open to
	  anyone at all)</p>
	<p>
	  Formal proposals should be treated as normal bugs, and after
	  the discussion period are either closed (when incorporated
	  in policy, or roundly rejected as undesirable), or are
	  demoted to (forwarded?) wish list bugs. I like them being
	  demoted to forwarded status, since the upstream authors (the
	  policy mailing list) has already had a stab at them, and
	  they have been shelved until furhter notice. </p>
	<p>
	  I think that the Policy is critical enough for the project
	  that any real flaws in the policy be automatically be deemed
	  important bugs, unless they affect release management.</p>
