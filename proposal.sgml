      <heading>Introduction, and Administrivia</heading>
      <p>
	This is a proposal for creating a process through which the
	Debian Policy documents are to be maintained and updated, it
	sets forth the processes, and also calls for the creation of a
	team responsible for the task of updating policy, however,
	this team does not act as author or editor of Policy itself,
	that is the task of the Debian Policy mailing list.
      </p>
      <p>
	It should also be pointed out that this proposal itself does
	not call for the modification of the Policy documents
	themselves. I would rather not rush into anything as serious
	as modification of the formal policy documents themselves, and
	I suspect that we would learn and refine this process in
	practice. I would rather that the formal modifications be
	deferred until after the kinks of this process have been
	worked out.
      </p>
      <p>
	Another thing that bears mentioning is that this proposal is
	only for the every day routine functioning of the policy
	group. Traditionally, the policy group, under the aegis of the
	Policy editor, worked on the basis of a consensus derived in
	the group. This proposal merely removes the need of a
	dedicated policy editor, and passes the Debian packages that
	contain the policy into the hands of a few people who no
	longer exercise editorial control, and, paying homage to our
	growth, relaxes the requirement for a consensus.
      </p>
      <p>
	This is not supposed to change the way the group works, except
	in minor detail. There are some policy changes are light
	weight and can be decided upon within the policy group, by
	near consensus.  In most day-to-day cases, the Policy group
	should and must be able to conduct Policy discussions and
	amendments without the intervention of the Technical Committee
	or other Constitutional issues.  Only in cases of extreme
	dispute (formal objection) should the intervention of
	Constitutional bodies come into play. In any other situation,
	the Policy group should be able to conduct business
	unfettered.  This is the only way we can continue to improve
	Debian.

	<heading>Deadline for tabling the discussion</heading>
	<p>	  
	  I decided to use the suggested "usual" period of two weeks
	  for this proposal. Therefore, this proposal needs to be
	  acted upon before August the 22nd, 1998.

	<heading>People Seconding the Proposal</heading>
	<p>	
	  Well, since Michael Alan Dorman, Phil Hands, and Richard
	  Braakman have volunteered to serve on the policy maintainer
	  team, I think they have no objection to being
	  seconds.

	<heading>The policy maintainers team</heading>
	<p>
	  I propose we select/install a group of people who have
	  access to the CVS repository for the Policy documents;
	  however, this set of people behave more like maintainers
	  rather than authors/editors. This group does not create
	  policy, nor does it exercise editorial control, Policy is
	  decided "upstream".  The group that decides on policy should
	  be the group of developers on the Debian-policy mailing
	  lists, which is how it was always done; so the group of
	  policy maintainers have no real power over policy. Since
	  they would have access to the CVS repository I guess it is
	  desirable that the people so appointed be ``mature'',
	  however that is determined.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I think that since the policy maintainers have no special
	  powers, there is no need to restrict their participation in
	  the discussion. We do need to have at least 4-5 people on
	  the job, preferably closer to 8, so that policy does not
	  languish when any maintainer goes missing (we do need
	  vacations, you know, once in a while), and since little
	  creative power is vested in the maintainers, we do not need
	  a central control. And the archives of the list can be used
	  as a record of the action decided upon even if all
	  maintainers are away at some time.
	</p>
      </sect>
      <sect>
	<heading>The CVS Repository</heading>
	<p>
	  There should be a repository set up on
	  <tt>cvs.debian.org</tt> for this, with the people on the
	  policy maintainer team having write access to it. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  The repository should contain all the packages under the
	  control of the team, and also should have an area where the
	  weekly status document is kept; once the document is under
	  CVS, it should be a simple matter to script exporting the
	  document out to a place where the web server can serve it,
	  as well as create the weekly posting to
	  <tt>debian-policy</tt> and <tt>debian-devel</tt> mailing
	  lists. This document could also be kept under CVS then.</p>
	<p>
	  If possible, a separate mailing list (<tt>debian-policy-admin</tt>)
	  maybe created which gets copies of all the CVS commit
	  notices.

      <heading>Procedures and Processes</heading>
      <sect>
	<heading>Proposing amendments to the Policy</heading>
	<p>
	  Unlike before, when the policy editor gathered in issues
	  which, in his view, were candidates for inclusion in policy,
	  I propose that issues are brought up in the policy group,
	  and, if the initial discussion warrants it, any developer,
	  with at least two(?) seconds can formally propose as a
	  policy amendment.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The rationale behind the requirement for seconders is that
	  it would<enumlist>
	    <item>
	      <p>
		Encourage people to test the waters on the policy
		mailing list, and this could help create an proposal
		with a better chance of success</p>
	    </item>
	    <item>
	      <p>
		Prevent frivolous or ill conceived proposals from
		wasting peoples time (If the proposal does not even
		convince two developers, surely this is not ready for
		inclusion in Policy?)</p>
	    </item>
	  </enumlist>
	</p>
	<p>
	  The whole discussion process is meant to be light weight; If
	  you wish the proposals to be amended, talk to the proposer,
	  and get the amendment in. Or else, post an alternative, and
	  let the  group decide which one is better.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If the process gets very contentious, and needs something
	  like votes on amendments and withdrawal of proposal, then
	  this is not the correct forum for this, and the procedures
	  outlined in the constitution should be followed. Note that
	  only non-technical issues can be resolved using the general
	  resolution protocol; technical issues would hopefully be
	  resolved in the group itself, or the technical committee can
	  be called upon to render a decision.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This document is not supposed to supplant the processes
	  outlined in the constitution, nor is it an end run around
	  them.
	</p>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Notifications and Status Reports</heading>
	  <p>
	    Periodically, possibly weekly, a summary of current policy
	    topics can be posted to the Developers mailing list, as
	    well as to the policy mailing list. Since the BTS is used
	    for keeping track of policy amendments, the list of
	    current amendments shall always be on the web.</p>
	  <p>
	    Amendments to policy that have been accepted by the policy
	    group shall also be part of the notification. (recently
	    resolved bugs)
	  </p>
	</sect1>
      </sect>
      <sect>
	<heading>Deadlines for Tabling Discussions</heading>
	<p>
	  It has been observed in the past that discussions on the
	  mailing list devolve into endless arguments. In order to get
	  away from the debating society aspect, at the time of the
	  formal proposal, a deadline can be set (probably by the
	  proposer, since they are likely to have an idea how
	  contentious the discussion is likely to be) for ending
	  discussion on the issue, which should rarely be less than 10
	  days, and typically two weeks or so. I hope that a hard
	  minimum period need not be set, and that the proposers would
	  be reasonable, and not set too short or too long a time for
	  discussion.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If a consensus is reached by the policy group, then the
	  maintainers shall enter the amendment into the Policy
	  document, announce the inclusion in the periodic report, and
	  release a new version.</p>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Extensions to Deadlines?</heading>
	  <p>
	    If a deadline is approaching, and the discussion s almost
	    concluded (in other words, it has not reached an impasse),
	    and the consensus on the policy group is that an extension
	    of a week would resolve the issues better, a one-time
	    extension could be granted. Care should be taken in
	    exercising this option, since abusing this would merely
	    postpone closures. Anything that is still not resolved is
	    too contentious not to be sent to the full set of
	    developers in a general resolution proposal.
	  </p>
	</sect1>
      </sect>
      <sect>
	<heading>Deadlock resolution</heading>
	<p>
	  Formerly, arriving at a consensus was the only way to amend
	  Policy. That worked well when the Project was small,
	  however, we have apparently grown out of that phase, and even
	  the policy mailing list has grown more fractious than in the
	  days of yore. We now need a formal process of deadlock
	  resolution, and we need to recognize that on non-technical
	  issues a small minority should not always hold up deployment
	  of policy.</p>
	<p>
	  If a consensus is not reached, (or if someone submits a
	  formal objection to the proposal) and the end of the
	  discussion period is near, then one is faced with a dilemma.
	</p>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Impasse on Technical Issues</heading>
	  <p>
	    On technical issues, popularity is a bad way of arriving
	    at conclusions. Hopefully, the policy group would arrive
	    at a consensus on their own. If that fails to happen, or
	    if there is a formal objection raised on the issue, and
	    the issue is a technical one, then the technical committee
	    may be consulted. This should be a rare occurrence. </p>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
	  <heading>Non Technical and Subjective Disagreements</heading>
	  <p>
	    However, if the issue is non-technical and subjective,
	    then a vote of the developers may be taken (USENET voting
	    software should be available all over the place, right?);
	    and a super-majority of 75% is needed to carry the
	    amendment through. Failing the super-majority, the issue
	    should be shelved. It may be re-submitted as a a fresh
	    proposal after a suitable cooling off period (which should
	    be no less than a month, typically three months being
	    desirable, unless there are significant new
	    developments). (Demote bug, if the BTS is being used)</p>
	  <p>
	    If the issue raised is especially contentious, or is
	    deemed to be suitable for review by the full set of
	    developers, then four or more developers can call for a
	    hold on the proposal, and move to send the proposal to the
	    larger developer body as a General
	    Resolution. <strong>Note:</strong> The constitution may
	    have additional requirements for submitting a General
	    Resolution, for example, a minimum number of seconders,
	    etc.

	<heading>Using the Bug Tracking System</heading>
	<p>
	  A fascinating sub proposal has been that we use the bug
	  tracking system to track policy amendments in progress. If
	  this is used, we may initiate discussions in the policy
	  group by filing wish-list bugs (note: this should be open to
	  anyone at all) This simplifies how me manage and track open
	  amendments and issues.  I think both re-titling and the
	  severity of the bugs can and should be used.</p>
	<p>
	  <taglist>
	    <tag>Issue raised</tag>
	    <item>
	      <p>
		wishlist bug opened in BTS, with a subject of
		"[PROPOSED] ...". This is the pre discussion period,
		when the idea is kicked around, and polished. There is
		no preset time limit, but at some point, if it is
		stalled, the bug should be closed. Only registered
		Debian developers may formally create proposals. 
	      </p>
	      <p>
		developers may second the issue by emailing "seconded"
		to the BTS. Only registered Debian developers may
		second proposals. 
	      </p>
	    </item>
	    <tag>Amendment</tag>
	    <item>
	      <p>
		when a proposed issue becomes a formal amendment (when
		it has acquired the required number of seconds), the
		bug severity is raised to "normal" and the bug is
		retitled to "[AMENDMENT DD/MM/YYY] ...".  Actually it
		might be better to close the proposal and reopen so
		the bug date reflects when the clock starts ticking on
		the bug. 
	      </p>
	      <p>
		This sets up the table for a discussion period,
		normally 10 days to a month. At the end of the
		discussion period, a proposal is either accepted, or
		rejected. 
	    </item>
	    <tag>Accepted</tag>
	    <item>
	      <p>
		if the amendment is accepted, the bug is marked
		forwarded and retitled "[ACCEPTED DD/MM/YYY]...".
	      </p>
	    </item>
	    <tag>Rejected</tag>
	    <item>
	      <p>
		if the amendment is closed, it is retitled as
		"[REJECTED  DD/MM/YYY] ..." and closed
	      </p>
	    </item>
	    <tag>Incorporated</tag>
	    <item>
	      <p>
		When the proposal is actually integrated into Policy
		and uploaded and moved into the archive, the bug is
		closed. 
	      </p>
	    </item>
	  </taglist>
	</p>
	<p>
	  I think that the Policy is critical enough for the project
	  that any real flaws in the policy be automatically be deemed
	  important bugs, unless they affect release management.</p>
