debian-policy (2.5.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * AMENDMENT: Added in changes in Bug #25911, which rearranged sections
    to create a new section 4, namely, files. Section 3.3 ("Files") should
    become Section 4.  The Sections that are currently Section 4 and
    Section 5 should be moved down to become Section 5 and Section 6
    accordingly. 

    What is now Section 5.5 ("Log files") should be moved to be a
    subsection of the new Section 4 ("Files"), becoming section 4.8,
    placing it after "Configuration files", moving the would-be Section
    4.8 ("Permissions and owners") to Section 4.9.  All subsections of the
    current Section 5 after 5.5 should be accordingly moved down to fill
    in the number gap. 

    This, along with the next amendment, justifies bumping up the version
    number. closes: BUG#25911
  
  * AMENDMENT: Added in changes in Bug #21185, about the naming and
    compression of changelog files. Now, if the upstream changelog file is
    HTML formatted, it should be accessible as
    /usr/doc/<package>/changelog.html.gz It also allows for this to be a
    symlink, if the upstream file name does not conform to Debian
    conventions. closes: BUG#21185

  * AMENDMENT: Added in changes in Bug #7890, to make clear that the HTML
    documents should be supplied in _some_ package, not necessarily in the
    main binary package (at the discretion of the maintainer). 
    closes: BUG#7890
  
  * AMENDMENT: Added in changes in Bug #26461, which corrects the policy
    to refer to /usr/doc/<package>/copyright, rather than
    /usr/doc/copyright/<package>. closes: BUG#26461
  
  * AMENDMENT: Added in changes in Bug #25385, which allow the
    architecture specification strings to be of the form <arch>-<os>,
    where os is one of linux, gnu. Previously, only linux was allowed, now
    we also cater to the hurd. closes: BUG#25385
  
  * The responsibility of the contents of this package has now passed to
    the debian-policy mailing list. The packaging details are now being
    managed by a group of maintainers that do ot won the contents. 
  
  * Make the package optional, not extra. 
  
  * Re did the SGML markup. Normalized the document, and undid the omitted
    and shor tags. Personally, I use too many DTD's in real life to be so
    converssant with each one to be clever with tag omissions, and, since
    I have a smart editor, omitting tags does not byuy one much. In the
    process, I discovered a few errors in the markup (one of my
    predecessors hasd the unfortunate habit of treating <p> as a "create
    some space here" tag, and more often than not put it at the end of a
    paragraph, rather than using is as a container element (which is what
    it is, really). 
  
  * Re did the control files, making them more robust
  
  * re did the rules file, making it more general, and easier to maintain
    by putting in a layer of abstractions.

  * Orphaned package

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Thu, 14 May 1998 21:54:50 +0200

debian-policy (2.4.1.0) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Changes to the Debian Policy Manual:

    - Updated section 3.1.2 Site-specific programs
          and section 3.8 Keyboard configuration:
      + improved wording (fixes:bug#20129)
  
    - Updated section 2.1.7 Subsections:
      + fixed typos (fixes:bug#18145)
  
    - Updated section 3.3.5 Symbolic links:
      + symbolic links within a toplevel directory should be relative,
        symbolic links between toplevel directories should be absolute
        (cf., Policy Weekly Issue#6, topic 2)

    - Updated section 3.4 System run levels:
      + Intro: mention /etc/rcS.d (links to boot time scripts)
      + Notes: include rationale why /etc/init.d scripts have to be tagged
        as conffiles (fixes:bug#16199)
      + Example: changed example init.d script to handle force-reload
        and restart options and to comply with the console message
        standard (fixes:bug#19216)

    - Updated section 4.8 Emacs lisp programs:
      + Replaced old section about lisp programs with a reference to
        the file debian-emacs-policy.gz, installed by the emacsen-common
        package.
  
    - Updated section 4.9 Games:
      + manpages for games should be installed in /usr/man/man6
        (cf., Policy Weekly Issue#6, topic 3)
  
    - Removed one example reference to the current standards version
    - Include manual's date as plain text in the .sgml source so that
      a recompiled manual uses the same release date

  * Changes to the authoritative list of virtual package names:
    - Removed obsolete virtual package `emacs'

  * New version numbering scheme:
  
    - The version numbers are independent of dpkg now, but all policy
      manuals (the Debian Policy Manual, the Debian Packaging Manual, and
      the Debian Developer's Reference) share the same version numbering
      scheme.
    
    - The first three digits of the version number specify the
      `Standards-Version.' This number is incremented with each policy
      change. The fourth digit represents the `patch-level,' which may
      differ between the manuals. 
  
      If only the patch-level digit is incremented, no changes in policy
      have been made, except bug fixes and clarifications. Packages only
      have to specify the first three digits of the version number in the
      `Standards-Version' field of their source packages.
  
  * Packaging changes:
  
    - Uploaded to frozen and unstable. This is a documentation-only
      package and the changes to the manual are relevant for hamm.

    - Fixed FSF's address in copyright file (detected by Lintian)

      + scripts including bashisms have to specify /bin/bash as

        (e.g., in /tmp) should use tempfile or mktemp for creating
        the directory

    - Updated section 3.3.5 Symbolic Links:
      + symbolic links referencing compressed files must have the same
        file extension as the referenced file

      + /dev/tty* serial devices should be used instead of /dev/cu*

    - Updated section 3.4.2 Writing the scripts [in /etc/init.d]:
      + all /etc/init.d scripts have to provide the following options:

        the service

      + cron jobs that need to be executed more often than daily should
        be installed into /etc/cron.d

    - Updated section 3.7 Menus:
      + removed section about how to register HTML docs to `menu'
        (the corresponding section in 4.4, Web servers and applications,
        has been removed in policy 2.2.0.0 already, so this one was
        obsolete)

    - New section 3.8 Keyboard configuration:
      + details about how the backspace and delete keys should be
        handled

    - New section 3.9 Environment variables:

    - Updated section 4.7 Programs for the X Windows system:
      + programs requiring a non-free Motif library should be provided
        as foo-smotif and foo-dmotif package
      + if lesstif works reliably for such program, it should be linked
        against lesstif and not against a non-free Motif library

    - Updated section 4.9 Games:
      + games for X Windows have to be installed in /usr/games, just as
