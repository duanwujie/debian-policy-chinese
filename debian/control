Description: Debian Packaging Manual
 This package installs the Debian Packaging Manual. 
 .
 This manual describes the technical aspects of creating Debian binary
 and source packages.  It also documents the interface between
 dselect and its access method scripts.  It does not deal with
 the Debian Project policy requirements, and it assumes familiarity
 with dpkg's functions from the system administrator's perspective.
